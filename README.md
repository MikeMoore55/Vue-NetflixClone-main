## Description

The aim of this project is to use VUE, Html, JavaScript and CSS to make a functional clone of Netflix

## TOTALLY LEGIT NETFLIX

Welcome to "Totally-legit-Netflix"

Totally-legit-Netflix is a Netflix clone built with JavaScript, Vue, Html and CSS. It has the core styling and basic functionality of the actual Netflix.

## Full Disclosure!
- The movies & series used in this app are not mine and only the trailer of each can be played for obvious reasons.

- The movies & series used in this app are not found on Netflix, they are just my preferred movies & series selections.

- style is similar to netflix, but i added my own personal touch

## BackLog
